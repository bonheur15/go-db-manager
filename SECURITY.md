# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Go DB Manager project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us as quickly as possible.

**Please do NOT open a public issue on GitHub for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report it by sending an email to [your-security-email@example.com](mailto:your-security-email@example.com). (Replace with your actual security email address).

In your report, please include as much detail as possible:

*   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or exploits.
*   Your contact information (optional, but helpful for follow-up).

We will acknowledge your email within 24-48 hours and aim to provide a more detailed response within 7 days, including an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.

## Disclosure Policy

We kindly request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it. We will work with you to coordinate a public disclosure once the vulnerability has been patched.

## Supported Versions

We only provide security updates for the latest stable release of Go DB Manager. We encourage users to always use the most recent version.

Thank you for helping to keep Go DB Manager secure!
